i learned a few things from these readings. This reading sections provide a lot of usefull information for beginners like me. It lays out the simple ideas of how certain things go in the process of generatig graphics with object based and image based workings.

A few things that i have learned is that

1. Over the years, Graphic Processing units have become more advanced and some have even become more complex than a cpu. They have in recent years been containing over 100 processing units, to which are user programable.

2. that early graphics systms used general purpose computers that had the standard von neumann architecture that produces one instruction at a time with one processing unit.

3. there are 4 steps in the imaging process with those being vertex processing, clipping and primitive assembly, rasterization, and fragment processing.

4. that pipeline architectures are the dominant type of high-performance systems.
